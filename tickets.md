# Tickets

One upside of doing this via git is that I am able to break requirements up into "tickets" and map them 1:1 with my PRs. 

- [ ] TC-01: Initial setup of documentation
  - Write up my initial documentation framework
- [ ] TC-02: Define initial tickets
  - Convert the list of requirements from the prompt into a series to tickets to work on one by one
